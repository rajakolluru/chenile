/**
 * Generates IDs given a request context. This class is useful to generate predictable IDs for entities
 * given a request ID. This is essential for replicating systems i.e. systems that replicate the same
 * data in multiple machines by replaying the same end user request in these machines. E.g., let us say
 * that we want to generate identical Orders in a store machine and a cloud machine. The IDs of the
 * Order cannot differ between multiple machines.<br/>
 * If you use this IDGenerator, then the IDs will be the same since they all are based out of a
 * request ID that is shared between the replicating machines.<br/>
 * Class needs to be used statically since it is designed to be called by entities in their
 * JPA \@PrePersist and \@PreUpdate methods.
