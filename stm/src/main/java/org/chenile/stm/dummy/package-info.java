 * This package contains a set of dummy components which can be used to instantiate a state
 * diagram without instantiating the components.<br/>
 * This is useful to get info about the state transition diagram without actually
 * instantiating the State Transition machine.<br/>
 * It also contains a dummy STMFlowStore that can be used to instantiate the flow impl
 * without instantiating the individual components.<br/>
