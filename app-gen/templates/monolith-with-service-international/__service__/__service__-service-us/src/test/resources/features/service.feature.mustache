Feature: Tests the {{service}} Service using a REST client. 
 
  Scenario: Trial test. Change it according to the actual service

    When I construct a REST request with header "chenile-trajectory-id" and value "us"
    And I POST a REST request to URL "/{{service}}/op1" with payload
    """
    {
	 
		}
		"""
		Then the REST response key "id" is "{{Service}}ServiceImplUS"

		Scenario: Health check test. 

    When I construct a REST request with header "chenile-trajectory-id" and value "us"
	  And I GET a REST request to URL "/health-check/{{service}}Service" 
		Then the REST response key "message" is "{{Service}}US is fine!"
