# How to upgrade chenile version
These instructions are for Chenile maintainers to upgrade the version of chenile to a new version.
Let us say new version is a.b.c. Do the following:

0. Make sure that everything builds good with "make build" 
1. Edit chenile-version.txt and pom.xml and replace existing  versions with a.b.c
2. git add .; git commit -m "Bump up to a.b.c" ; git push origin main
3. make tag tag=a.b.c # this wil create the tag
4. make build # All the builds in local maven repo will have the latest version now.
5. passphrase="<secret phrase>" make deploy  # this will deploy to Maven Central
6. make push-tags # pushes the newly created tag into origin
7. make list-local-tags # ensures that the new tag is there locally
8. make list-origin-tags # ensures that the new tag is there in origin.
9. Edit chenile-version.txt and pom.xml to reflect the next snapshot
10. make build once again
11. Publish the snapshot as well and ask your current developers to rely on the snapshot while your non current developers will rely on the latest published version.
12. Don't forget to edit the config/setenv.sh in chenile-gen repo.
13. Finally, if you want you can upgrade the chenile-samples to rely on the latest version of chenile.
